    "## **1. Risk-Free Interest Rates**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Financial Markets course, we learned about credit risk with investing in bonds. Credit risk, which is assumed by the bond investor, is the risk that the bond issuer will default on the bond. An entity with a high credit rating or credit score can borrow money from financial markets at a lower interest rate compared to an entity with a lower credit rating. In the U.S., government-issued bonds (U.S. Treasuries or Treasuries) are usually considered high credit rating bonds. Therefore, Treasury yields are usually used as **risk-free rates** for bond price evaluations in the financial industry. There are a lot of debates about whether U.S. Treasuries are actually safe with no risk of default. Different scenarios will need different considerations. In this lesson, we'll follow current financial market convention by using U.S. Treasury yields as risk-free rates.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Another key concept in credit risk is credit spread. **Credit spread** or **credit premium** is the interest rate difference between a corporate bond and a government bond of the same maturity. This interest rate difference is also called **excess return** of the corporate bond since the government bond yield is risk-free interest. The excess return of the corporate bond is the additional return to a corporate bond holder to take on additional risk in holding this corporate bond.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Since risk-free interest rates are a key element not only in bond pricing but also in other financial asset pricing and portfolio management, it is crucial to understand the characteristics and behavior of risk-free interest. In this lesson, we will use U.S. treasury (or treasuries) yields as risk-free interest to investigate their behavior and conduct analysis.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "## **2. Volatility of U.S. Treasury Yields**\n",

    "## **3. Treasury Bond Price-Yield Curve**\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In Figure 1, we can see that when the yield/interest of a bond increases, the price of the bond will decrease. Conversely, when the yield/interest of a bond decreases, the price of the bond will increase. There is a negative relationship between the bond price and bond yields. However, when yield changes by one unit, the price change varies depending on where the yield level is when yield change happens.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This is another key point to pay attention to in the bond price-yield relationship: the bond price and bond yield do not have a linear relationship; they have a convex relationship. This non-linear relationship between bond price and bond yield has an important implication in interest rate risk management for bond investment. Let's use the following Figure 2 to explain the concept.\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Based on the convex nature of the bond price-yield curve depicted in Figure 2, the amount of price change when yield changes by the same amount varies depending on yield level. In Figure 2, D1 and D2 have the same length. When the yield changes by D1, the amount of price change is P1. When the yield changes by D2, the amount of price change is P2. However, the yield level for D1 is higher than the yield level for D2. Because of the convexity of the price yield curve, P1 is smaller than P2.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The feature of this relationship between bond price and bond yield is called **curvature**. The example above demonstrates that the slope of the price-yield curve changes when the level of the yield changes. The curvature of the price-yield curve is used to describe this slope dependency on yield level. A bond portfolio manager will have to pay attention to the curvatures of the bond holdings when managing interest rate risk.\n",

In this section, we will introduce methods to fit a yield curve. We will continue to use U.S. Treasury bond yields as an example. First, let's make a graph for the U.S. Treasury yield curve on 2020 January 10th."

The decay rate is between 0 and 1. $\\beta_{0}$ is used to describe the level of the yield curve. $\\beta_{1}$ is used to describe the slope of the yield curve and $\\beta_{2}$ is used to describe the shape of the yield curve. For this reason, we also call the NS model a **yield curve factor model**. The NS model decomposes the yield curve into three elements as described above.\n",

    "## **5. Cubic Spline Fitting of Yield Curve**\n",
    "In this section, we are going to introduce another popular method to fit a yield curve with data. It is called **cubic spline**. Spline fitting is a method under polynomial fitting. Please read the required reading \"Spine Method of Interpolation\" to study the theory of spline fitting, especially cubic spline fitting. We'll use the cubic spline fitting method in Python to fit a yield curve in the next section. Please be advised that in Lesson 4 \"Application of Quadratic Spline Interpolation\", there is a mistake in the note. In the big matrix presentation, the coefficient vector should be on the left-hand side of the equation, not the right-hand side.\n",

    "In this section, we'll demonstrate how to fit a yield curve cubic spline. For ease of demonstration, we will only use yields from 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 30-year Treasury bonds on 2020-01-10 as an example. Let's check the yields on 2020-01-10 first."
